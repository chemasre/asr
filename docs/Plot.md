OVERLOOK'S CORRIDORS (Continues) INT

THE GRADY TWINS

Come play with us, Danny.

TONY

Don't listen to them! Get back!

(break)

Let's find another way.


THE BATHROOM (Continues) INT

DANNY meets MR GRADY in the bathroom (it has a red door) 

MR GRADY

-- I have two daughters, you now?

-- They are a little older than you.

-- But so, so noisy...

-- Soon the clients will complain.

-- And that cannot happen.


NEAR THE ELEVATOR (Continues) INT

Danny passes casually near an AXE. It's inside a box fixed to the wall, protected by a crystal, as a decorative element.

If is the first time Danny sees the axe.

TONY

-- How would you get that axe, Danny?

DANNY

-- I have to break the glass.

TONY

-- Exactly!
